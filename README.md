# t-SNE

The aim of this project is to apply t-sne to explore quick draw data category - 'smiley faces'.

(t-SNE) t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is a dimensionality reduction algorithm used for exploring high-dimensional data. t-SNE maps the multi-dimensional data to a lower dimension and discovers pattern in the data by identifying similarity of data points .

Quick draw provides dataset in various formats. Numpy bitmap format which is a  28x28 grayscale bitmap is used.
The dataset of 'smiley faces' is explored  

t-SNE reduces this 28x28 dimensional data to 2D and clusters similar data points.

A quick observation that can be seen is that all the smiley faces without face boundry are clustered together.

A subset of the 'smiley face' dataset is used with 400 grayscale images
